## Project Summary

We are planning to use the YouTube Trending Video Dataset from Kaggle.com. This dataset provides various information such as views, likes, tags, and more about daily trending videos on YouTube. We plan to utilize this dataset to create a video querying service and host it on a website. Our inspiration for proposing this website came from one limitation of YouTubeâ€™s search engine. Only video titles are queryable; any other metadata of a video such as view count, like count, comment count are unsearchable in the traditional YouTube searching process. Therefore, our project idea will provide extra flexibility to users when searching for videos, without them having to explicitly memorize the title.
